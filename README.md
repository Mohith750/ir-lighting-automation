# ðŸ’¡ IR Sensor-based Lighting Automation

This project uses an IR sensor to detect motion and automatically turn lights ON/OFF.

## Features
- Motion-based automation using IR sensor
- Saves energy by turning off lights when no motion is detected
- Simple and effective for smart home systems

## Components
- Arduino UNO
- IR Sensor
- LED
- Resistors, Breadboard, Wires

## Connections
- IR sensor OUT â†’ Pin 2
- LED â†’ Pin 13

## Code
Upload `ir_sensor_automation.ino` to Arduino using Arduino IDE.
