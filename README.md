# ðŸ’¡ IR Sensor-based Lighting Automation

This project uses an IR sensor to detect motion and automatically turn lights ON/OFF.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Motion-based automation using IR sensor
- Saves electricity when room is unoccupied
- Simple and useful for smart homes

## ðŸ”§ Components
- Arduino UNO
- IR Sensor
- LED
- Breadboard, Resistors

## âš™ Circuit Connections
- IR Sensor OUT â†’ Arduino Pin 2
- LED + Resistor â†’ Arduino Pin 13 (with GND)

## ðŸ§  How It Works
When motion is detected, the LED turns ON.  
If no motion is detected, the LED turns OFF automatically.

## ðŸ›  Upload Instructions
1. Open Arduino IDE  
2. Paste code from ir_sensor_automation.ino  
3. Connect board â†’ Upload code â†’ Done!

## ðŸ“· Output Example
Motion Detected - Light ON No Motion - Light OFF

## âœ… Learning Outcome
- Simple automation logic using digital sensors
- Real-time response with Arduino
